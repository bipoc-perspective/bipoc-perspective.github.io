      <p>Aisha’s first year of high school was in a public school in Fortaleza, Brazil. This school was a reformed prison and lacked a lot of resources to provide an education for students. She highlights that they did not even have teachers for some subjects sometimes. After this, she went to a professional school where she could get a high school diploma along with a professional education. For being a competitive school, few black students attended. Although she had a lot of resources and opportunities from this school (for example learning German, nursing certificate course), she never felt heard when relating to microaggressions she had to go through during her high school years. <span id="pauloFriere">From her experience in a low-income neighborhood and international system, she never felt totally prepared for Wellesley College </span> and felt that there is a lack of support: “Resources were always to remedy instead of prevent.”</p>
