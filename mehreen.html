      <p><span id="paoloFreire">Mehreen is no stranger to marginalization or resistance.</span> As the eldest daughter to Bangladeshi immigrant parents and the only hijabi muslim girl at her high school in Long Island, Mehreen has constantly been in positions to advocate for herself and her community. Mehreen’s education prior to Wellesley was not utopian, but better than the standard education that many FGLI youth receive from their schools. Interestly, Mehreen’s high school was ethnically and racially diverse, but POC students were still in the minority; however, POC students were in majority in the higher tracked classes. Moreover, Mehreen’s struggles within the education system were not significantly academic, but mostly revolved around her role as a caregiver and translator for her parents.</p>
      <p> The significant home responsibilities that Mehreen dealt with allows her vision of education justice to shift beyond the “we need more diversity narrative” to a demand for recognition of the many responsibilities that student of color balance in addition to academics. Her vision of education justice at its core focuses on communal care and inclusion and the deliberate efforts to build support networks for students whose very existence is a struggle. Education justice to Mehreen means that the ideas and experiences of marginalized students are never stifled, and that the comfort of the privileged are not the focal point. Mehreen’s vision of education justice requires elite institutions like Wellelsey to devote more time to figuring out the different issues that affect students of color and diverting resources to first-generation low-income students in and outside of the classroom. </p>
