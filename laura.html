      <p>Laura studied her high school in a UWC in Norway. For being in an international school, the student body from her school was diverse in nationality. However, she highlights that although they had a diverse student body, students of color in reality were still fewer than she expected. She did not feel belonging in this environment for this, and said that the Norway culture was the dominant one. Her high school supported her to apply to Wellesley and she felt prepared in the sense of taking classes in English already. When she came to Wellesley, she said she found more diversity for sure. However, low-income and black students still have less opportunities to thrive. Although, as she said, Wellesley has a lot of programs, an aspect largely discussed in the student body was the financial aid package that does not include stipend to students' lives or emergency funds. The lack of financial security <span id="paolofreire">creates an environment of anxiety, insecurity and lack of belonging sense</span>. She finalizes our interview saying that Wellesley should think more about practical support rather than symbolic ones.</p>
