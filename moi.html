      <p>Moi attended a public school in Fairfax Country, Virgina. During her time in high school, she was enrolled in the IB program, which she believed to have helped her get to Wellesley. She noted that IB was perhaps the hardest thing she’s ever done academically, though it encouraged her to think and write in a particular way. Her high school’s student body was more diverse than Wellesley's, as there was a larger Black and Brown population, as compared to the predominantly white and East Asian population at Wellesley. Perhaps as an Education major, it was easier for Moi to retrospectively notice inequities that occurred in her high school. Specifically, she talked about how Latinx students who spoke Spanish as their first language were at a huge disadvantage, and at the time, she didn’t realize that dual-language programs were possible. She also noted that there was a distinct difference between how teachers and faculty treated East Asians and Southeast Asians, as the students who were always receiving disciplinary punishments were largely Southeast Asian and Latinx.</p>
