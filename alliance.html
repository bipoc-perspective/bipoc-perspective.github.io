      <p><span id="paoloFreire">Throughout the interview,</span> Alliance repeated her love for her high school. Her school was a prestigious, competitive, small school with a commitment to girls' education and her classmates are some of the brightest people she knows! Together, they all worked hard to attend universities abroad. This was fostered by her teachers, whom she was able to get really close to through daily office hours, clubs and sports. Before coming to Wellesley, her school’s alumni helped prepare her for the transition by sharing more about American and college culture. However, coming here was still a new experience; in this foreign environment, she feels different. However, through <span id="paoloFreire">allyship with other Rwandan students</span> through cookouts and more, she has found a home on campus.</p>
      <p>For Alliance, educational justice is a world where regardless of any factors, everyone has access to opportunities essential to their academic success.</p>
