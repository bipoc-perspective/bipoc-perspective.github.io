      <p>Anonymous went to a public school in what is considered a bordertown in TX. The majority of both the students and the teachers at the school were Hispanic. The resources at their high school were sparse, with no internet connection provided and no support for students who didn’t have access to the internet at home. They noted that not only was dual enrollment costly for students but required a consistent internet connection that some students simply did not have access to. In order to fully take advantage of educational opportunities available to the students, they had to stay up very late into the night consistently to achieve the same/similar results to her Wellesley peers. They felt very unprepared for the academic environment of Wellesley due to the difference in high school education as compared to her classmates. Though they originally came to Wellesley hoping to be able to fully take advantage of resources, they found that as an FGLI student there are <span id= "paoloFreire">more barriers</span> and <span id="paoloFreire">less support</span> from administration to achieve those same goals.
