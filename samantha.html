      <p>Sam attended Morris Knolls High School in New Jersey, a public school around the same size as Wellesley. In high school, Sam took primarily AP courses, which helped prepare them for the coursework at Wellesley, but the school also had an IB program that students applied for beginning in middle school. Although their high school was predominantly white, and Black and Hispanic students consisted of around or less than 10% of the population, Sam noted that the IB program was more diverse. She highlighted that while her race didn’t affect her experience in the classroom, she noticed that the school’s college guidance counselor wasn’t giving them the same information as their other friends. Specifically, when applying to colleges, Sam learned about HWC’s and Wellesley in particular from her white friends whose parents were more involved in their college application process. In order to make Wellesley more equitable, Sam noted that the college should make information on the various career resources it provides more available and accessible to students.
