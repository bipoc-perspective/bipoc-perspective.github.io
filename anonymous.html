      <p>Anonymous attended a public school near Memphis, Tennessee. With the continual rise of privatization of schools in the Memphis area, a lot of students near that area ended up attending Houston High School. She described a more tolerant and less racist community after the transition from middle school to high school as a lot of the white affluent families began attending private schools. While she described being valued academically, she found that there was a stark difference between the way her existence was valued in the extracurricular environment. There was a heavy emphasis placed on band and football, but most other student organizations were not granted these privileges of having more funding and more space to practice. While band and football had their dedicated spaces, the orchestra and art clubs were given a small storage closet. Teachers often had to be cautious about what they were allowed to say in the classrooms for fear of predominantly white affluent parents backlash especially with LGBTQ topics. Parents would accuse the teachers of teaching “radical gender ideologies” and try to censor inclusive discussion within the classroom.
