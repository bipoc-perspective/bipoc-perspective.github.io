      <p><span id="paoloFreire">Education justice to Buanna Francois means a focus on diversity and inclusion for all students and teachers of color in th education system.</span> Achievement First offers multiple after school programs and various academic classes, but lacks diversity amongst faculty despite the large Black population of students. Buanna contends that her school did prepare her for some academic aspects of Wellesley such as writing essays and existing in predominantly white environments, but her school did not prepare for the more nuanced aspects of being a college student. Buanna recommends implementing better systems of punishments and incentives for teachers and students as well as building networks of support for students. Also, quality  neighborhood schools are important so that students are able to attend schools in their own network and increase parent involvement.</p>
